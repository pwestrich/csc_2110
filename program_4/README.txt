Description
————————————
   This program reads a list of zip codes from a file and puts
them into a binary search tree to work with.

Compiling
————————————
   To compile the program from its source code, navigate to 
the directory where the code is located, and type the following
command:

	g++ -o <executable_name> main.cpp

where <executable_name> is what you wish to name the program. 
Be sure you have the appropriate C++ compiler for your machine
installed correctly.


Usage
————————————
   To use the program, navigate in your command line to the 
directory where the program is located. To run it, type the
following command:
	
	./<executable_name> <textfile_name>

where <executable_name> is the name of the program, and 
<textfile_name> is the name of the text file containing the 
database. Omit the “./“ on a Windows machine.

This program was written, tested, and debugged using Xcode 4.6
in Mac OS 10.8.3. I do not have the means necessary to do so
on a Windows machine. Therefore, I cannot absolutely guarantee
to work flawlessly on one.
